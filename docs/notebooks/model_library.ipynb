    "\n",
    "Throughout, we consider settings in which potentially multi-product firms, indexed by $f$ compete across markets, indexed by $t$.  In each market, there are $J_t$ products offered.  Each firm $f$ offers a distinct subset of those products, $\\mathcal{J}_{ft}$. We use the $jt$ index to denote observations at the product-market level and we use the $t$ index to denote the vector which stacks all of the $J_t$ observations in market $t$.  Demand for product $j$ in market $t$, which depends on $p_t$, the price of all products in the market, is denoted $s_{jt}(p_t)$.  Relizations of market shares across products in market $t$ at the equilibrium prices $p_t$ are denoted $s_t$. We denote the $J_t \\times J_t$ matrix of own- and cross-price derivatives as $\\frac{\\partial s_t}{\\partial p_t}$, so that the $(j,k)$-th element denotes the marginal effect of an increase in the price of product $k$ on the market share of product $j$.     \n",
    "\n",
    "The researcher observes, in each market $t$, realizations of equilibrium prices and shares for a true model of conduct which generated the data: $p_t$ and $s_t$. The reasearcher does not know the true model, but wishes to test a menu $M$.  For each model $m$ in the menu, the stacked first order condition in market $t$ can be expressed as:\n",
    "$$p_t - c_{mt} = \\Delta_{mt}$$\n",
    "Here, $\\Delta_{mt}$ are the stacked markups implied by model $m$ in market $t$.  For the models we consider, the markups $\\Delta_{mt}$ can be expressed as known functions of prices and exogenous variables and typically depend on the demand system.  Thus, given equilibrium outcomes, the known market structure (i.e., which firm sells which products), and the demand system, $\\Delta_{mt}$ can be computed.  $c_{mt}$ are the marginal costs implied by the model which satisfy the system of first order conditions. \n",
    "\n",
    "To specify a menu of models in pyRVtest, the researcher creates a `ModelFormulation` for each of the models in the menu when defining the testing problem.  In what follows, we show how to specify the `ModelFormulation` for the class of models that the code can currently handle.  "
