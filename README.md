This code was developed by Christopher Sullivan and Lorenzo Magnolfi.  It largely adapts the pyblp source code (copyright Jeff Gortmaker and Christopher Conlon) to perform the procedure for testing firm conduct developed in "Testing Firm Conduct" by Marco Duarte, Lorenzo Magnolfi, Mikkel Solvsten, and Christopher Sullivan.
