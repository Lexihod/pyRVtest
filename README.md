# pyRV

This code was developed by Christopher Sullivan and Lorenzo Magnolfi.  It largely adapts the pyblp source code (copyright Jeff Gortmaker and Christopher Conlon) to perform the procedure for testing firm conduct developed in "Testing Firm Conduct" by Marco Duarte, Lorenzo Magnolfi, Mikkel Solvsten, and Christopher Sullivan.


## Install
You will need to first install four python packages: 
* numpy
* pandas
* statsmodels
* pyblp

These should be installed by running the pip3 install command in either terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows).  Foe example, to install numpy, run the following:

    pip3 install numpy

Next, you should download the pyRV

in python3
pyRV_path = '././pyRV_folder'
